This is a simple log file processing system.

The "LogFileProcessingSystem" folder is the JAVA project. It contains all my source code for this project.

The "demo" folder contains two runnable jar files of my solution, and some instructions about how to run them.

The "sample_data" folder conatins two sample datasets.
